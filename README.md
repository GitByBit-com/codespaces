**Note: The initial launch can take up to a minute.**

## How to Use

1. Click the **START** button above to launch a new GitHub Codespace with GitByBit pre-installed and ready to use.

2. Once you see VS Code UI, wait **patiently**. It'll take up to a minute to initialize everything (the editor must download and install GitByBit, then install Fish as the terminal shell).

3. When the GitByBit panel appears on the left sidebar — you're good to go!
